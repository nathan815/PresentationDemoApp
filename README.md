# Simple Stopwatch App

This simple stopwatch app is for my presentation on React Native that I am giving as part of my internship at Learning A-Z. Works on both iOS and Android.

Meant to be very simple, since I am building it during my presentation in front of an audience. 

## Try it out
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`
